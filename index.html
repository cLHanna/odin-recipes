        <h3>Here are some delicious recipes to try!</h3>

        <p class="intro">I love food so much that I came up with an idea to do something that I've always wanted to do-collect all my favorite 
        recipes and put them all on one page. A cornucopia of random dishes spilling out onto the dinner table, filled with color 
        and smell, shapes and sizes. Instead of neatly organizing by meal, or type I wanted to see what would happen if I just 
        forgoed all the pagentry of normal recipe websites and just make the most basic, mundane one I could. One with no direction 
        or vision for overall "vibe" or "style". Just a 2000's-era plain-Jane frontpage with a scattering of who-knows-whats to 
        contrast the background. 
        </p>
        <p class="intro">Some might be thinking at this point (let's be honest-no one's thinking about this), that this is just a desperate attempt 
        to make paragraphs in order to test my html and css skills. Absolutely not! I've been using them for almost a full week now
        and I confidently say there's nothing left to learn. I've mastered the Internet and all its bits and bytes and bots and 
        (place on more "b" word here. DON'T FORGET!). So since there is nothing left and I've conquered web-design so quickly I just 
        thought I'd give back to the online community. All few billion of us. Most of who will be reading this very soon. In return 
        for everything I give you some recipes I've not ripped off the Internet but have painstakenly perfected over many years of 
        trial and error. Not really but I don't want my project site to be filled with lorem ipsum.
