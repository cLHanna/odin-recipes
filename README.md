This repos I've created is to test all my HTML knowledge up to this point. This will include basic HTML structures and file organization as well as using the git syntax of "adding" and "committing". 
Finally, this will be included on GitHub to test my understanding of "pushing" local file changes to a repository and just as important adding "Commit Messages".
